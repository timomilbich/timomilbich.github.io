My interest and passion for processing and analyzing any kind of visual content sparked during my studies in Mathematics and Scientifc Computing, which I fully dedicated to the areas of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Optimization. I am now happy to dive further into their depths while persuing a Ph.D. at the Heidelberg Collaboratory for Image Processing (HCI), one of Germany's largest institutes in this area. Under the supervision of Prof. Björn Ommer I actively contribute to research in learning representations for and similarities between images, as well as analyzing human poses and their dynamics.

Aside from my research and teaching duties, I love to play Volleyball with my team and friends, hike and get lost in nature around the globe or just spend my time in cafes with learning new things from books.
